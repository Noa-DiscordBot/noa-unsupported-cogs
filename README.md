# Noa's Unsupported Cogs
This repository contains all that everything that is no longer supported on the main repository. At most, we will be pushing fixes for "breaking changes", or just ignore the cogs here entirely. <br> Feel free to fork the cogs in the repository whilst respecting the license in the cogs. We will be providing **little to no support** for these cogs. Use at your own risk. <br>

For the supported cogs, please head to the main repo [here](https://github.com/Noa-DiscordBot/noa-cogs).
